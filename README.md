Folders Leaflet-Step-1 and Leaflet-Step-2 are the same. Both include index.html which can be used to display the website. Both also include a static folder with css and js folders inside that hold the style.css file and the config.js and logic.js files.

The content of Leaflet-Step-1 (which is currently identical to the content of Leaflet-Step-2) was copied to main as well (appearing as index.html and a static folder containing needed css and js data). The reason for this was to allow github pages to run the data from Leaflet-Step-1 as a webpage at the below location.
